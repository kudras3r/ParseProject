#
## What is it for?
### This bot will help you and not only you analyze all universities in your city to find the best option.
#
## Advantages
#### The main benefit is that from now on it is no longer necessary to go to the website of each university manually for an infinitely long time, look at the necessary faculties and spend so much time. You can just run the parser directly from telegram and save a lot of time!
#
## How it work?
#### Everything is very simple. The program is divided into 2 files. In the first one, the process of collecting data from the PostupiOnline website takes place, and in the second file, a bot is launched that can give you the opportunity to work with the bot directly from Telegram without any problems. 
#
## What do you need and what will you get?
#### 1) Nothing! - just choose a city.
#### 2) You will receive a 'json' or 'xlsx' file with all the universities in your city, distributed by programs, links to them and the number of points.
